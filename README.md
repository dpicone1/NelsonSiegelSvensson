# NelsonSiegelSvensson
The Nelson-Siegel and its extension Nelson-Siegel-Svensson are two of the most popular yield curve models. They are very useful when we do not have nicely spaced bond quotes to build the discounting factors. Sometimes up until certain maturities there are two many bonds compared with the number of maturities, and not sufficiently bonds thereafter. Very often, there are multiple bonds maturing in the same months. We have prepared two notebooks: in one "Fitting_BondPrices_with_NelsonSiegelSvensson_Models" we build the curve of Discounting Factors form a set of US treasury, coupon and zero coupon, bonds and in a second "Fitting_SpotRates_with_NelsonSiegelSvensson_Models" we fit a curve of Zero Rates.
