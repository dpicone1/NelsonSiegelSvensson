# NelsonSiegelSvensson
The Nelson-Siegel and its extension Nelson-Siegel-Svensson are two of the most popular yield curve models. They are very useful when we do not have nicely spaced bond quotes to build the discounting factors. Sometimes up until certain maturities there are two many bonds compared with the number of maturities, and not sufficiently bonds thereafter. Very often, there are multiple bonds maturiting in the same months. There are also several issues when trying to calibrate the model on real market data. We are planning to cover the topic in two Python notebooks. The first contains an introduction, while in a second future notebook we will deal with a more robust caibration
